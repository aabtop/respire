# Ebb

## Introduction

Ebb is a C library allowing you to build streaming data flow and computation
dependency graphs.  It can for example be leveraged to create a build system.

## Modifying the code

Ebb uses the [git subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo) extension
to manage its third party dependencies.  You do not need to download this
unless you are intending to manage these third party repositories within
the Ebb repository.
